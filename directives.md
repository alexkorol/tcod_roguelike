 Based on the error message, it looks like the issue is in entity_factories.py where you are trying to instantiate the HostileEnemy AI component. 

The HostileEnemy initializer requires an Engine instance to be passed in, but you are trying to instantiate it without passing one.

To fix this:

1. In entity_factories.py, change the HostileEnemy instantiation to:

```python
ai_cls=HostileEnemy,
```

2. Then when you create the Actor instances, pass the engine like: 

```python 
orc = Actor(
    #...
    ai_cls=HostileEnemy(engine),
    #...
)
```

3. Also in entity.py, update the Actor initializer to accept the engine and pass it to the AI component:

```python
def __init__(
    #..., 
    engine: Engine,
    #...
):
    #...
    
    self.ai: Optional[BaseAI] = ai_cls(self, engine) if ai_cls is not None else None
    
    #...
```

4. Make sure when you create the Engine instance in main.py, you pass it to the Actor factories:

```python 
engine = Engine(...)

orc = entity_factories.orc(engine) 
```
