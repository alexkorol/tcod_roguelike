## Overview

This is a basic roguelike game using the libtcod library. The player explores a procedurally generated dungeon, fights monsters, and collects treasure.

## Quick start:

Install Python 3.8+ and libtcod 1.6.7+.

```
pip install tcod
```

Download the repo.
Run 'python3 main.py' to start the game.

## Requirements:

Python 3.8+
libtcod 1.6.7+

To move the player, use the arrow keys or numpad. To wait a turn, press '.' or '5'. To attack an enemy in an adjacent space, move into their space.

## Current known issues:

No items/inventory system implemented yet.
Only two enemy types (orcs and trolls).
Map generation is very basic.
No saving/loading functionality.
