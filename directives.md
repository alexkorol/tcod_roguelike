1. ~~In the `actions.py` module, the import statement for the `Item` class is missing (`from entity import Item`). Make sure to import the `Item` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

2. ~~In the `engine.py` module, the import statement for the `MainGameEventHandler` class is missing (`from main_game_event_handler import MainGameEventHandler`). This import is needed for the `Engine` class to have access to the `MainGameEventHandler`.~~

3. ~~In the `entity.py` module, there is a missing import for the `RenderOrder` enum class (`from components.render_order import RenderOrder`). Make sure to import the `RenderOrder` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

4. ~~In the `main.py` module, there is a missing import for the `RenderOrder` enum class (`from components.render_order import RenderOrder`). Make sure to import the `RenderOrder` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

5. In the `main.py` module, the `render_messages` function is not defined. It seems like this function is supposed to render the messages from the message log, but it is missing. You need to define this function or remove any references to it if it is not needed.

6. ~~In the `input_handlers.py` module, there is a missing import for the `BumpAction` class (`from actions import BumpAction`). Make sure to import the `BumpAction` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

7. In the `input_handlers.py` module, the `ev_quit` method is defined but is not being used. If this method is not needed, you can remove it to avoid any potential issues.

8. ~~In the `entity_factories.py` module, there is a missing import for the `RenderOrder` enum class (`from components.render_order import RenderOrder`). Make sure to import the `RenderOrder` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

9. ~~In the `game_map.py` module, there is a missing import for the `Entity` class (`from entity import Entity`). Make sure to import the `Entity` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

10. ~~In the `procgen.py` module, there is a missing import for the `Entity` class (`from entity import Entity`). Make sure to import the `Entity` class to avoid any unresolved references.~~

These are the issues and bugs that I found based on the provided codebase. Please note that there may be other issues or bugs that are not immediately obvious without running the code and testing it thoroughly.
